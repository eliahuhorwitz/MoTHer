Our proposed *Model Graphs* and *Model Trees* are new data structures for describing the heredity training relations between models.
In these structures, heredity relations are represented as directed edges. 
We introduce the task of *Model Tree Heritage Recovery* (MoTHer Recovery), its goal is to uncover the 
unknown structure of Model Graphs based on the weights of a set of input models.

The code will be published in the coming days...
